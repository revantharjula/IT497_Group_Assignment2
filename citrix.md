      In this assignment we are preparing sentiment analysis results to predict the stock price of the company citrix, such that we can compare the stock price against our sentiment analysis which might be useful for buying stock of that company.
      
   For this task to be completed we have created 5 Histograms as shown above, each showing a detailed daily sentiment analysis starting from December 1st  to December 5th , we have collected 5 days data to understand the behavior of sentiment analysis and the we have created a table which shows the data for the sum of sentiments for each day and the Stock price change for that respective day. The stock price change values have been calculated as the daily stock price change * 100.
   
  We have also created a bar graph which captures the details of current stock value and the stock value predicted by sentiment analysis, side by side. This graph helps us to evaluate the results generated by sentiment analysis
